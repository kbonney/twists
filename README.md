# twists
Here we twist Siegel paramodular forms

The goals of this project can be summarized as follows:

1. Calculate the Fourier coeffecients for Siegel Eisenstein series

2. Print a given selection of coefficients into a .json file

3. Create cusp forms via arithmetic on the Siegel Eisenstein series

4. Twist these cusp forms using the methods laid out in [Fourier coefficients for twists of Siegel paramodular forms (expanded version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05463)
